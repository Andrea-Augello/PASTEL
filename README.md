# PASTEL

To compile the PASTEL interpreter, from the _src_ folder run the command `make pastel`.
In the  _bin_ folder you will find the pastel executable `pastel` and the files generated by Flex and Bison.

In the  _testfiles_ folder there are some sample programs which can be run by the interpreter though the command `./pastel ../testfiles/<file_name>.pa`
